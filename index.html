                <section class="p">Hey there! I'm Morgan Hamlin, and I'm training to be a full-stack developer through Georgia Tech, with a specialization in CSS and Javascript. After graduating from Florida State University with a B.S. in Environmental Science, I began working as a communications intern at the Grant Park Conservancy. It was through that internship that I discovered my love for web development. I hope to find work with a web design firm, or  a marketing agency that provides both a challenging and supportive workspace.</section>
